in your SSH session on the ca-vm control plane node, enter the following command to create a deployment resource file:


cat <<EOF > deployment.yml
apiVersion: extensions/v1beta1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: game-deployment
spec:
  # tells deployment to run 1 pods matching the template
  replicas: 1
  # create pods using the pod definition in this template
  template: 
    metadata:
      # name is automatically generated based on the deployment.name
      labels:
        app: game
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: tetris
        image: lrakai/tetris:latest
        ports:
        - containerPort: 80
EOF
The deployment declares a single replica and specifies a single Docker container. The container image is hosted on Docker Hub.
